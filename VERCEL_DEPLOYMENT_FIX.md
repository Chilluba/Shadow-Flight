# ✅ Vercel Deployment Fix

## Problem Fixed
The error `Environment Variable "API_KEY" references Secret "api_key", which does not exist` has been resolved.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Removed Secret References
- Removed `@api_key` secret references from `vercel.json`
- The game now works without any environment variables

### 2. Updated Environment Variable Names
- Changed from `API_KEY` to `VITE_API_KEY` (Vite standard)
- Updated all documentation to reflect the change

### 3. Made API Key Optional
- Game works perfectly without the Google Gemini API key
- Uses pre-written fallback flight messages when no API key is provided
- AI-generated messages are now an optional enhancement

## How to Deploy on Vercel

### Option 1: Without API Key (Recommended for quick deployment)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Deploy - no environment variables needed!

### Option 2: With AI-Generated Flight Logs
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Add environment variable:
   - Name: `VITE_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your Google Gemini API key
4. Deploy
